Shipment Website

The Website is a Capstone Project on one of the Trainings I have finished recently in EPAM Systems.
The websites main functionality is to Manage orders between 2 users, one of which is the user who sends the shipment (from now on as "Sender"), and the other user is the user who ships and delivers the shpiment (from now on "Shipper").

MAIN FUNCTIONALLITY
___________________
Users who Sign Up (Create an account) have the opportunity to be both Shipper or Sender. When a User Logs in, he can create and manage Shipment options and Orders.

Lets say the Shipper has logged in, they can now create a new shipment Option, stating the departure adn arrival ocations and dates, with the maximum available space, and how much money they will require for that service. 
When the sender logs in and tries to place an order, they should choose the departure and arrival locations, 2 date between which they want the item delivered, and optionally the weight of the order they want to place. Then a list of available shipment options pops up, and the Sender can choose their desired option.
When they choose the option, both Sender and Shipper are informed about the Order via email which they used to sign up. Both Sender and Shipper can cancel the order, and they will be notified about it via same email again.
